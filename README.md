# PertInv
###### Zach Bednarke

The purpose of this project is to determine the impact of non-ideal sensor geometries
and calibration on source localization estimates.

Alterations to mne code are listed in mnealterations.txt.  mne functions that refer to perturbed sensor data,
but are otherwise unchanged in functionality, are kept within this repository and renamed accordingly.
