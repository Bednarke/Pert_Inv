Running list of alterations to mne code

-simulate evoked -  changed iir averaging very high to make noise go away - Necessary
-dipole.py  -fit dipole search using cobyla with rhoend=5e-6, minimal boost
            -but uncommented simplex code so I could use maxeval=10000,
             accuracy seems capped either by algorithm GOF goal or
             simply lower bound on error...
