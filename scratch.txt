Scratch file for development and to-do




TODO
-Find out how to turn eeg off in info so I dont have to hardcode eeg=False
- Start Documenting in mne style
-Static link to data file in _make_perturbed_forward
-create coil geometry class
-Can I get simplex to approach from above and below so I can average errors better?
-Use averaging to put numbers to how much better it is.  see if worth
-I want a file to house functions that will be called within pert_inv
Pert Inv will handle construction of Px\Omega and pass them to its subfuncs
-First is stc & fwd. Param: Dip obj in head coords, coil obj. Return: pert fwd, shared stc unpert fwd
-Second is simulation. param: pert stc+fwd, unpert fwd, return Dipole objects pert_dip_fit, unpert_dip_fit
-Third step is logging data
