Running list of alterations to mne code

-dipole.py  -fit dipole search using cobyla with rhoend=5e-6, minimal boost
            -but uncommented simplex code so I could use maxeval=10000,
             accuracy seems capped either by algorithm GOF goal or
             simply lower bound on error...
            -make_pert_forward_dipole has eeg hardcoded to False
            -mne.forward.make_forward_solution also has eeg=False
